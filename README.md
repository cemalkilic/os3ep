# os3ep 

os3p stands for Operating System Three Easy Pieces. It is a free online
operating systems book. The link to book is: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/

I created this simple python script to download the book which is in form of
chapter-by-chapter. Instead of downloading all chapters manually, renaming and
ordering by hand, I created this simple script.

It is simply gets the table where book content is placed. Parses the table and downloads the PDFs in parallel, thanks to multithreading.
